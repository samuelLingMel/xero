# xero interview questions

I gave the interview questions more thought after the test and here are my answers when given more time.

The first was when given a list of offices and the amount of coffee they drink each month could I write a funciton in javascript to return the name of the office, the total cups of coffee drunk and the average cups of coffee for each month for each different office name in the list.

The second was gave a income report and wanted this to be processed into just a revenue number.

The last two I might not be remembering 100% correctly but here is the gist:

The third question was for two sql database, one for heroes and and another for sidekicks, the questions was to write a sql select statement to show every hero with a sidekick.

The fourth question gave was for a two databases this time for heroes and another for the comics thay have appeared in. The question here was to show each hero and the amount of times they had apeared in comics.
